# The Hayao Design Codex

**A generative game-design library for AI agents.** Where [`docs/FUN.md`](../docs/FUN.md),
[`docs/JUICE.md`](../docs/JUICE.md), and [`docs/JUDGE.md`](../docs/JUDGE.md) prove a
game *isn't broken*, the Codex is the front half: it turns a high-level intent —
*"design an RTS with deeply strategic choices, faction asymmetry, and visually
impressive battles"* — into a concrete, creative, buildable design **before** the
proof playbook ever runs.

The engine pre-solves *implementation*. This library pre-solves *conception*: it
gives you reference DNA to anchor to, modular systems to compose, a twist formula
to make it yours, and a pipeline that ends where FUN.md begins.

> **You are still the designer.** The Codex is scaffolding, not a slot machine.
> It exists so you spend your creativity on the *twist* and the *feel*, not on
> re-deriving what every roguelite already knows about meta-progression. Compose
> the known, then bend it.

## How to use it — the design pipeline

Run these in order. Each stage names the modules that drive it. Do **not** open
`examples/` for ideas (see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)); design from the mechanic
and the fantasy, using this library as your parts bin.

```
INTENT ──▶ ANCHOR ──▶ COMPOSE ──▶ TWIST ──▶ SHAPE ──▶ HANDOFF ──▶ (FUN/JUICE/JUDGE)
```

1. **INTENT → brief.** Parse the request into a design brief: player fantasy,
   the one-sentence hook, scope, hard constraints. → [`00-process/intent-to-brief`](00-process/intent-to-brief.md)
2. **ANCHOR.** Name the 1–3 touchstone games this *is*. Pull their design DNA —
   the load-bearing structures, not the theme. "This is Overcooked-like" imports
   a solved core loop for free. → [`10-anchors/`](10-anchors/)
3. **COMPOSE.** Assemble the design from modular pieces — genre template + the
   systems it needs (progression, economy, combat, factions…). Genres blend;
   satisfy every parent. → [`20-genres/`](20-genres/) · [`30-systems/`](30-systems/)
4. **TWIST.** Add the creative bend that makes it *not* a clone. Apply a twist
   vector (theme, mechanic-swap, structure, perspective, constraint, tonal). The
   verb is where a twist bites hardest — reach into [`60-mechanics/`](60-mechanics/).
   *Unrailed = Overcooked + voxel + roguelite + train.* → [`00-process/the-twist`](00-process/the-twist.md)
5. **SHAPE.** Derive pillars, the loop stack, the world, the verbs, and the
   aesthetic; check every choice against the pillars. → [`00-process/pillars`](00-process/pillars.md) ·
   [`00-process/core-loop`](00-process/core-loop.md) · [`60-mechanics/`](60-mechanics/) ·
   [`40-worldbuilding/`](40-worldbuilding/)
6. **HANDOFF.** Check the design against [`70-antipatterns/`](70-antipatterns/) for
   smells, convert it into the verification contract, and hand off to the proof
   playbook. → [`00-process/refine-and-handoff`](00-process/refine-and-handoff.md)

Stuck on conception? [`80-recipes/`](80-recipes/) shows the whole pipeline already
run on eight worked "X but Y" designs — read one for the *wiring*, not to reskin it.

Cross-cutting fun/polish concerns (feedback loops, risk-reward, mastery, pacing,
anti-frustration) apply at every stage → [`50-patterns/`](50-patterns/).

## Layout

| Dir | What's in it | Reach for it when |
|---|---|---|
| [`00-process/`](00-process/) | The pipeline: intent→brief, pillars, loops, **the twist**, composition, handoff | Running a design end-to-end |
| [`10-anchors/`](10-anchors/) | Reference-game **DNA** — touchstones distilled to load-bearing structure | Naming what a game *is*; importing a solved loop |
| [`20-genres/`](20-genres/) | Deep **creative** genre templates (pillars, loops, essential systems, seeds, pitfalls) | You know the genre; you need its design skeleton |
| [`30-systems/`](30-systems/) | The modular **systems library** — progression, economy, combat, factions, AI, rewards… | Composing the parts a design needs |
| [`40-worldbuilding/`](40-worldbuilding/) | Theme / lore / faction / aesthetic **kits** | Giving the design a world and a look |
| [`50-patterns/`](50-patterns/) | Cross-cutting **fun & polish** design patterns | Any stage — these are always on |
| [`60-mechanics/`](60-mechanics/) | The **verb library** — the atomic things a player *does* (dash, parry, rewind, merge) | Deciding what the hands do; designing from the mechanic |
| [`70-antipatterns/`](70-antipatterns/) | Named **failure modes** — the mirror of patterns | Checking a design for smells before handoff |
| [`80-recipes/`](80-recipes/) | **Pre-composed designs** — worked "X but Y" compositions | Seeing the parts already assembled |
| [`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md) · [`index.json`](index.json) | The searchable index of every module (id · kind · tags · summary) | Looking something up by keyword |

> **Generate a starting point:** `node scripts/compose-design.mjs spark` samples an
> anchor + genre + verb + systems + a twist vector into a fresh brief to design
> from. `list` / `show` / `graph` search and walk the library from the terminal.

## Searching the Codex

Every module carries YAML frontmatter with `id`, `tags`, `use-when`, and
`composes-with`. To find pieces:

- **By keyword:** `grep -ri "asymmetr" design/` or search [`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md).
- **By tag:** `grep -rl "tags:.*economy" design/`.
- **By relationship:** follow `composes-with:` and inline `[[module-id]]` links.

IDs are stable and namespaced by kind: `process-*`, `anchor-*`, `genre-*`,
`system-*`, `world-*`, `pattern-*`. A link like `[[system-faction-asymmetry]]`
always resolves to `30-systems/faction-asymmetry.md`.

## The relationship to the proof playbook

The Codex hands off; it never duplicates. When a module needs to state *how you
prove the thing is fun/fair*, it **links** the matching entry in
[`docs/FUN.md`](../docs/FUN.md) (mechanical truth + verify pattern),
[`docs/JUICE.md`](../docs/JUICE.md) (feel gates), or
[`docs/VERIFICATION.md`](../docs/VERIFICATION.md) rather than restating it. Design
here; verify there. A design isn't done until it names its proofs —
[`00-process/refine-and-handoff`](00-process/refine-and-handoff.md) is the seam.
